# Number-Guessing

How to play:

1. You first get asked a difficulty to pick from. You would then need to select from the following options:
   Easy(10 Chances)
   Medium(5 Chances)
   Hard(3 Chances)

2. You will then be given a specific number of attempts based on which difficulty you picked.
   You then need to guess which number is the program thinking of from 1-100.

3. If your answer is lower than the number the program will tell you your answer is lower than the number.
   If it's higher than the number the system will tell you it's higher than what the number you picked.

4. Once you run out of lives the game will end!
